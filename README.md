Sexual Encounter consent via blockchain - APPROVED 
Comment: related to #metoo movement and how this can help. one problem I see is adoption of the app for people with malicious intention. How do you deal with it? A mobile app would be needed more than web app 

Abstract:
During sexual encounters, nowadays a lot of things can go wrong. Think of unwanted videos, withholding information about STDs and offensive porn reenactment. While you're protected by law, litigating any offenses through court is nearly impossible in reality.

Proposed Solution:
The application will create a legally binding agreement, which means any offense is a breach of contract. By using the Live Contracts protocol, your private agreement is verifiable using the blockchain and enforceable with a single click.

Proposed Methodology: 
Web application: 
•	Both the parties will agree by providing their consent on the web app.
•	Upon the responses provided by both the parties a contract is established thus binding both the parties in legal terms.
•	The contract will be triggered using MetaMask(a JavaScript library for triggering blockchain)
•	Smart Contract to be implemented using solidity.
•	Other components of Web app will be implemented using ReactJs and Nodejs.
