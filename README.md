Idea 1:
Automating Insurance system through a valid medium of trust.

Abstract:
The insurance industry – one of the least digitalized – is not surprisingly one of the most ineffective segments of the financial services industry. Traditional scenario requires the victim of an accident to go through numerous process before he can claim his insurance. This could be overwhelming for the user.

Proposed Solution:
User initiates an insurance claim through web application. The claim will be validated against real-time data. Upon successful validation of the claim, blockchain will be triggered and the insurance amount will be processed instantly.

Proposed Methodology:
Web application: 
•	Reason for insurance claim (earthquake and other natural disasters)
•	The web app validates the claim against real-time data about earthquake and other natural disasters using REST APIs.
•	If the claim is valid, then smart contract will be triggered. Smart contracts will be developed using Ethereum blockchain and implemented using Solidity.
Details stored on smart contract:
•	Conditions which are likely in case of eventuality can be mentioned in the smart contract.
•	Upon satisfaction of certain events or a combination of events, a claim can be processed.


Idea 2:
Sexual Encounter consent via blockchain

Abstract:
During sexual encounters, nowadays a lot of things can go wrong. Think of unwanted videos, withholding information about STDs and offensive porn reenactment. While you're protected by law, litigating any offenses through court is nearly impossible in reality.

Proposed Solution:
The application will create a legally binding agreement, which means any offense is a breach of contract. By using the Live Contracts protocol, your private agreement is verifiable using the blockchain and enforceable with a single click.

Proposed Methodology: 
Web application: 
•	Both the parties will agree by providing their consent on the web app.
•	Upon the responses provided by both the parties a contract is established thus binding both the parties in legal terms.
•	The contract will be triggered using MetaMask(a JavaScript library for triggering blockchain)
•	Smart Contract to be implemented using solidity.
•	Other components of Web app will be implemented using ReactJs and Nodejs.


Idea 3:
Roadbnb

Abstract:
Finding a parking spot in of the most tiresome task these days. After driving on the busy streets and struggling with the traffic, just when you thought you did it, you reached your destination, you get a reality check - there is no place to park your vehicle. The solution is Roadbnb. If you want to make a few extra bucks, by renting your parking spot while you’re away working or on a trip, Roadbnb is the way to go. If you want to rent a vehicle, but the prices offered by rental companies are too high, the solution is Roadbnb.

Proposed Solution:
With Roadbnb, we provide, rental facility for vehicles as well as parking spots. Most housing communities allot one parking place per apartment. But a lot of times the residents don’t have vehicles, in case of students or new professionals, and their parking space is left unutilized. With Roadbnb they can upload their garage space for rent and earn some extra money. Also, multiple times there are visitors during the day who have a hard time finding space and working professionals who leave for their jobs in the morning and return late in the evening. They can upload their spot availability for suppose 9 hours in the day, and the visitors can look up and rent the spot for as little or as much time, but within the limit set by owner, as they want. This way the owners can earn extra money while they’re away and they get their spot when they want. They can also pull down their space from the market if they no longer want it to be available for people to rent.

Proposed Methodology: 
Website using MERN stack.
